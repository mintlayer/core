To run the test:

1. Make sure substrate-interface python package is installed, preferably, use this command for installation:
```
python -m pip install 'substrate-interface == 0.13.12'
python -m pip install 'scalecodec == 0.11.18'
```
2. compile Mintlayer
3. run the `test_runner.py`

You can choose the test you want by putting it as an argument to test runner. For example `test_runner.py example_test.py`
