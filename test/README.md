Functional tests system for Mintlayer

To run the test:

1. Make sure substrate-interface python package is installed
2. compile Mintlayer in debug mode (TODO: make this automatically detect the mode using config.ini and [code generation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-script-examples.html#code-generation)
3. run the `test_runner.py` script

You can choose the test you want by putting it as an argument to test runner
